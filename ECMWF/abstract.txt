The workshop aims to bring together scientists working on the various aspects of model development. In particular, interdisciplinary research and progress on numerical schemes, parallel and energy-efficient computing, coupling of resolved/subgrid-scale parametrised processes and multiscale interactions that could be relevant for numerical weather prediction are welcome.

Possibilities:

Curl-free pressure gradients

Monge Ampere on the sphere

Phil - moving meshes over orography

James - cut cells and multi-d advection

Me - Long time-step advection
